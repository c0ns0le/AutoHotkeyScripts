## OneKeyLock
Turn off your monitor and lock your desktop with one key -- `Scroll Lock`. See the settings for more options.

## BetterWindows
For you keyboard-loving folks, this app provides shortcuts keys for some usually used functions like New Folder, Hide/Show hidden files, Toggle extensions, etc. See the Hotkeys window for the complete list.

#HeadsUpConsole

Requires: [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/).
